                <p>
                    The users are frustrated because of not finding the perfect scent, shape, and style for their specific needs. People are tired of going to the stores and especially during this pandemic donâ€™t want to be around people or cannot take off their masks to smell the perfect candle for them. As a result, our solution should provide users a way to easily create the perfect candle for them and at risk free during the pandemic.
